### *Halo: Combat Evolved & Custom Edition Addon*
---

### Pardon my dust - in the process of converting HAC2 from a VS2010 project to CMake & VS2017 for continued development.

### Features:
* Introduces widescreen HUD support.
* Full field-of-view control.
* Discord integration, allowing you to display your game status on your Discord profile.
* Increases the render distance to improve the experience on large maps.
* Optic adds the ability to display medals similar to those from later Halo titles. Animations and events are fully customisable through Lua.
* Introduces in-game map downloading for both HPC and HCE, allowing you to join servers without having the maps already downloaded.
* Custom chat overhauls the in-game chat, offering a more aesthetically pleasing and customisable alternative to the default multiplayer chat.
* Server bookmarks allow you to join your favourite servers with keyboard shortcuts.
* Increases the number of objects that can be rendered.
* Increases the maximum number of triangles that the engine will render, allowing for higher quality map geometry and fixing issues in many existing maps.
* Dramatically improves game load times through map checksum caching.
* The ability to custom your HUD colour.
* Allows you to queue up to join a full server, even from your current game.
* Built-in sightjacker allows you to view the game from the viewpoint of other players.
* Removes version limitations ("version switcher") when attempting to view and join servers running older/newer patch versions.
* Allows for active camoflauge to be rendered correctly on supported ATi/AMD cards (added to patch 1.10).
* Allows for scope blur removal.
* A triangle count display to aid map makers in development and debugging.
